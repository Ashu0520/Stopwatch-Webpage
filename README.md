ABOUT THIS PROJECT-:

1. This project is a basic stopwatch application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It incorporates three fundamental buttons: start, pause, and reset, enabling users to control the stopwatch's operation.

2. The core functionality of the stopwatch relies on the utilization of the setInterval() function in JavaScript. This function facilitates the periodic execution of a specified function, enabling the stopwatch to increment time values continuously.

3. By combining these elements, users can effectively interact with the stopwatch, initiating its operation, pausing it as needed, and resetting it to its initial state, providing a simple yet functional timekeeping solution.
